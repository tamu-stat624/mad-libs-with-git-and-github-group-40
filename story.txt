Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Cam,

I am writing to you from a delicious spaceship in a claustrophobic galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a yellow rocket in September. There are 413 containers and chocolates of bus here! In the
living room there is a pool full of mango juice. I fall asleep each night on a beautiful bed of
plastic and dream of dance [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
